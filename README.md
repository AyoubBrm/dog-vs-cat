# dog-vs-cat
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify images of dogs and cats. The model was trained using deep learning techniques to predict whether an image contains a dog or a cat.

Project Overview
In this project, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is implemented to classify images of dogs and cats. The model uses a dataset containing labeled images of both dogs and cats. The goal is to train the model to recognize patterns in the images that distinguish the two animals.

Key Features:
Image classification: Classifies images as either a dog or a cat.

Deep Learning: Utilizes a CNN architecture for image recognition.

Preprocessing: Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques applied for better training.

Technologies Used:
Python: Programming language used for model development.

TensorFlow: Deep learning framework used to build and train the CNN.

Keras: High-level API used for building the neural network.

OpenCV: Used for basic image processing tasks.

NumPy & Pandas: For data handling and manipulation.
